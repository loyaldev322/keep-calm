At the heart of our engineer productivity tool is a cutting-edge technology stack that is designed to enhance collaboration and efficiency. We leveraged the power of Replit, an interactive and collaborative coding platform, to develop and test our code in real-time.

For seamless communication, we used Discord, a powerful messaging and voice chat app, to facilitate team discussions and provide updates on project progress.

To ensure that all code changes were tracked and managed effectively, we used GitHub as our primary version control system. This allowed us to work collaboratively with other developers, review each other's code, and ensure that all changes were properly documented and tested before being deployed.

By utilizing these powerful tools and technologies, we were able to build an engineer productivity tool that is both reliable and effective, and that can help engineers improve their workflows, increase productivity, and drive better results.

## Challenges we ran into üôÅ

Building our engineer productivity tool was not without its challenges. As a remote team, we faced a number of obstacles that made collaboration and communication difficult at times. However, we overcame these challenges by leveraging the power of the right tools and technologies.

One of our main challenges was hosting the project on GitHub pages and Netlify. We had to learn the ins and outs of these platforms, and work through issues related to deployment and configuration. But with persistence and a lot of hard work, we were able to get the project up and running smoothly.

Another challenge we faced was collaborating using GitHub. Working with a distributed team meant that we had to be diligent in keeping our codebase up-to-date, and that we had to be careful not to overwrite each other's changes. However, we used GitHub's powerful version control features to ensure that all changes were properly documented and tested before being merged.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üòá

We're incredibly proud of the accomplishments we've achieved in building our engineer productivity tool. Perhaps the most notable of these accomplishments is the fact that we were able to complete the project within a tight deadline of just 24 hours.

Despite the time constraints, we were able to leverage our expertise and experience to build a powerful and effective tool that can help engineers boost their productivity and efficiency. We worked tirelessly throughout the project, using the latest technologies and best practices to ensure that the tool was reliable, scalable, and easy to use.

In the end, we are proud of what we accomplished in just 24 hours, and we believe that our engineer productivity tool is a testament to our team's talent, creativity, and hard work.

## What we learnedü§î

we learned a great deal about the latest technologies and best practices in the field. We gained a deep understanding of AR medication techniques, and how they can be used to streamline workflows and boost productivity.

We also became experts in using Node.js for managing time tracking and task management, and we learned the ins and outs of Pomodoro techniques for maximizing focus and efficiency.

In addition to these technical skills, we also learned how to collaborate and work remotely with peers. We became experts in using tools like Replit, Discord, and GitHub to facilitate communication and collaboration, and we developed strong teamwork and project management skills that will serve us well in our future endeavors.

## üöÄ How we have used **Github** in our project? üöÄ

We used Github in different ways:

**Pull Requests and Issues:** We created pull requests on our GitHub repository as we were a team of three and we're working on our local repository. If any of our team members gets an idea for a new feature, she would suggest it for all members to see and receive their opinions on how to implement it.

**Github Branches** Github branches helped a lot for beta testing of updated code before merging the new code into the original code. Our team approximately created 2-3 branches during the hackathon.

**Github Pages** we deployed our website at https://akshitagupta15june.github.io/Keep-Calm-and-Carry-On.github.io/ using Github pages. It was really simple to deploy our site through GitHub pages and we are planning to use this feature in future hackathons.

**Github Templates** We used the Github default LICENSE template for adding an MIT license to our project.

**Github Actions** Although implementing the actions was a kind of hectic task for our team but we tried to implement them for our pull requests. We still had to learn about GitHub's actions for future hackathons.


## What's next for Keep Calm and Carry Onüì≤
Looking ahead, our engineer productivity tool has enormous potential for growth and expansion. In the next phase of our project, we plan to add new features and functionality that can help engineers become even more productive and efficient.

For example, we plan to explore new ways to integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning into our tool, allowing engineers to automate repetitive tasks and gain valuable insights from their data. We also plan to expand our project management and collaboration capabilities, making it easier than ever for teams to work together and deliver results.

Overall, we believe that our engineer productivity tool has the potential to revolutionize the way that engineers work, and we are excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field.
